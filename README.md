## 15.7.1. Getting Ready: Code Together

Coding together allows you to work as a team so you can build bigger projects faster.

In this studio, we will practice the common Git commands used when multiple people work on the same code base.

You and a partner will begin by coding in tag-team shifts. By the end of the task you should have a good idea about how to have two people work on the same code at the same time. You will learn how to:

1.  Quickly add code in pull + push cycles  _(Important! This is the fundamental process!)_
2.  Add a collaborator to a GitHub Project
3.  Share  _repositories_  on GitHub
4.  Create a  _branch_  in Git
5.  Create a  _pull request_  in GitHub
6.  Resolve merge conflicts (which are not as scary as they sound)

This lesson will re-infroce the followingreinforces:

1.  Creating repositories
2.  Cloning repositories
3.  Working with Git concepts: Staging, Commits, and Status
